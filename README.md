## Notes

This was a side project I built in order to learn more about React and Routers. 

I wanted to make use of an API from where I could pull data and display it dynamically using React.
I started this project by installing create-react-app, and then building on to it using react, router, links and hooks. Furthermore, Sass was used to build the UI of this app.

This project also allowed me to get a better grip on creating custom hooks, resusable components and using the new react-router 6.3.

I used MealDB for the API to fetch content from and favicon.io to generate a favicon for this app.
